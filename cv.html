			<h3>Research interests</h3>
				My thesis work centered on data mining and computer architecture. I work on algorithms for retrieving valuable information from large scale datasets. One example is discovering frequent and rare patterns from large scale time series. Such information are important in several application areas, including anomaly detection, time series forecasting and bioinformatics. A second area of interest is exploring computer architectures for performance/latency/energy sensitive data mining algorithms and applications. For example, I exploited parallel computing platform to discover time series anomaly more quickly.

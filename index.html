						<h3>Biography</h3>

							Tian Huang starts studying in the School of Microelectronics at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University as a PhD student of Prof. Yongxin ZHU since 2010. He has published 2 SCI journal and 15 EI conference papers. His main research interest is Time Series Analysis, including time series big data indexing, anomaly detecting, and other time series related applications. He has rich experience on software and hardware co-designing.  He has built a tiny-scale cloud platform by the support of NDRC Project and developed maintenance and anomaly detection component for his researches.

						<h3>Research interests</h3>
							My thesis work centered on data mining and computer architecture. I work on algorithms for retrieving valuable information from large scale datasets. One example is discovering frequent and rare patterns from large scale time series. Such information are important in several application areas, including anomaly detection, time series forecasting and bioinformatics. A second area of interest is exploring computer architectures for performance/latency/energy sensitive data mining algorithms and applications. For example, I exploited parallel computing platform to discover time series anomaly more quickly.

				<h3>Biography</h3>
				<p>In March 2016, Tian Huang will graduate from <a href="http://ic.sjtu.edu.cn">School of Microelectronics</a> at <a href="http://www.sjtu.edu.cn">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>, where he completes his <a href="paper/huang2015large.pdf">thesis</a> under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/zhuyongxin">Yongxin Zhu</a>. His main research interest is Data Mining for time series, including time series big data indexing, anomaly detecting, computer architecture for time series data mining and statistical models for time series data. He has published 2 SCI journal and 15 EI conference papers. He has rich experience on software and hardware co-designing.  He has built a tiny-scale cloud platform by the support of NDRC Project and developed maintenance and anomaly detection component for his researches.</p>

				<h3>Research interests</h3>
				<p>My thesis work at <a href="http://ic.sjtu.edu.cn">School of Microelectronics</a> centered on data mining and computer architecture. I work on algorithms for retrieving valuable information from large scale datasets. One example is discovering frequent and rare patterns from large scale time series. Such information are important in several application areas, including anomaly detection, time series forecasting and bioinformatics. A second area of interest is exploring computer architectures for performance/latency/energy sensitive data mining algorithms and applications. For example, I exploited parallel computing platform to discover time series anomaly more quickly.</p>
				<p>My internship experience at <a href="http://www.i2r.a-star.edu.sg/robotics/jointlab">I2R-BYD Joint Lab</a> develops my research interest in Artificial Intelligence. I am interested in low cost localization in the scenario where GPS siginal and velocity is not accessible. One example is car driver uses his smart phone to navigate in underground constructions. I try to understand how map information can be used to improve localizaion. Based on the understanding I work on improving particle filter to find the position of a vehicle according to IMU and map informantion only. I am also interested in other research topics in computer vision for autonomous driving, including acquiring odometry and speed from stereo vision, road segmentation and lanemark detection.</p>
